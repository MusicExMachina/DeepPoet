I found my thrill ......on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill ......when I found you
The moon stood still ......on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until ......my dreams came true
(The wind in the willow played.......love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made...... were never to be)
Though we're apart......you're part of me still
For you were my thrill......on Blueberry Hill
(I found my thrill)...........Come climb the hill with me, baby
(on Blueberry Hill)............We'll see what we shall see
(on Blueberry Hill)...............I'll bring my horn with me
(when I found you)................. I'll be with you where berries are blue
(the moon stood still)................ Each afternoon we'll go
(on Blueberry Hill)..................... Higher than the moon we'll go
(and lingered until).................... Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(my dreams came true).................Ba-ba-da-d-bzz-bzz-va-d-in-da-day
The wind in the willow played .................. (do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody .........................(as I love you)
But all of those vows we made ................ (will you still remember)
Were never to be .......................... (when the night is through)
Though we're apart......you're part of me still
For you were my thrill......on Blueberry Hill

C'est si bon 
Lovers say that in France 
When they thrill to romance 
It means that it's so good 
C'est si bon 
So I say to you 
Like the French people do 
Because it's oh so good.
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear, 
Leads to only one thought 
And the thought is this, dear! 
C'est si bon 
Nothing else can replace 
Just your slyest embrace 
And if you only would
Be my own for the rest of my days 
I will whisper this phrase 
My darling, my darling... 
C'est si bon!
What good is sitting alone
In you room?
Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
Put down the knitting,
The book and the broom.
Time for a holiday.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
Come taste the wine,
COme hear the band.
Come blow a horn,
Start celebrating;
Right this way,
Your table's waiting.
No use permitting
Some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away.
Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret!
I used to have a girlfriend
Known as Elsie,
With whom I shared
Four sordid rooms in Chelsea
She wasn't waht you'd call
A blushing flower...
As a matter of fact
She rented by the hour.
The day she died the neighbors
Came to snicker:
";Well, that's what comes
From too much pills and liquor.";
But when I saw her laid out like a Queen,
She was the happiest... corpse...
I'd ever seen.
I think of Elsie to this very day.
I remember how she'd turn to me and say:
";What good is sitting alone
In you room?
Come hear the music play.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.
Put down the knitting,
The book and the broom.
Time for a holiday.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Come to the Cabaret.";
And as for me,
I made my mind up, back in Chelsea,
When I go, I'm going like Elsie.
Start by admitting,
From cradle to tomb
Isn't that a long a stay.
Life is a Cabaret, old chum,
Only a Cabarert, old chum
And I love a Cabaret.
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ";I love you";
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty-night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I'm longin' to linger till dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
(instrumental break)
Stars shining up above you
Night breezes seem to whisper ";I love you";
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Yes, dream a little dream of me
Georgia......Georgia..........the whole day through
Just an old sweet song.....keeps Georgia on my mind
I said now, Georgia.....Georgia......a song of you
Comes as sweet and clear.....as moonlight through the pines
Other arms reach out to me.......other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see.......the road leads back to you
I said, Georgia........ Georgia......... no peace I find
Just an old sweet song........keeps Georgia on my mind
(instrumental break)
Other arms reach out to me........other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see......the road leads back to you
Now ya know it's, Georgia....Georgia...no peace, no peace I find
Just this old, sweet song......keeps Georgia on my mind
Just this old sweet song.......keeps Georgia on my mind
Go down Moses

Let My People Go!'
So Moses went to Egypt land...
Let My People Go!
He made all Pharaoes understand...
Let My People Go!
Yes The Lord said 'Go down, Moses
way down in Egypt land

Thus spoke the Lord, bold Moses said:
-Let My People Go!
'If not I'll smite, your firstborn's dead'
-Let My People Go!
God-The Lord said 'Go down, Moses
way down in Egypt land 
tell all Pharaoes to
Let My People Go!'

I'll tell you why I can't find you
Every time I go out to your place...
You gone fishin' (well how you know)
Well there's a sign upon your door (uh-huh)
Gone fishin' (I'm real gone man)
You ain't workin' anymore (could be)
There's your hoe out in the sun
Where you left a row half done
You claim that hoein' ain't no fun (well I can prove it)
You ain't got no ambition
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool (Shangrila, really la)
I'm wishin' I could be that kind of fool (should I twist your arm?)
I'd say no more work for mine (welcome to the club)
On my door I'd hang a sign
Gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'
Papa Bing (yeah Louis)
I stopped by your place a time or two lately
And you aren't home either
Well, I'm a busy man Louis. I got a lotta deals cookin'
I was probably tied up at the studio
You weren't tied up you dog
You was just plain old...
Gone fishin' (bah-boo-bah-boo-bah-boo-bah-boo-bah)
There's a sign upon your door (Pops, don't blab it around, will you?)
Gone fishin' (keep it shady, I got me a big one staked out)
Mmm, you ain't workin' anymore (I don't have to work, I got me a piece of Gary)
Cows need milkin' in the barn (I have the twins on that detail, they each take a side)
But you just don't give a darn (give 'em four bits a cow and hand lotion)
You just never seem to learn (man, you taught me)
You ain't got no ambition (you're convincin' me)
Gone fishin' (bah-boo-dah-do-dah-do-dah-do)
Got your hound dog by your side (that's old Cindy-Lou goin' with me)
Gone fishin' (mmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm)
Fleas are bitin' at his hide (get away from me boy, you bother me)
Mmm, folks won't find us now because
Mister Satch and Mister Cros
We gone fishin' instead of just a-wishin'
Bah-boo-baby-bah-boo-bah-bay-mmm-bo-bay
Oh yeah!

You're lookin' swell, Dolly.......I can tell, Dolly
You're still growin'...you're still crowin'...you're still goin' strong

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La vie en rose
When you kiss me heaven sighs
And tho I close my eyes
I see La vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak...angels sing from above
Everyday words seem...to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be 
La vie en rose
Up a lazy river by the old mill stream
That lazy, hazy river where we both can dream
Linger in the shade of an old oak tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes up in the mornin', as we roll along
Blue skies up above ....everyone's in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we will be, now
Up a lazy river with me
(instrumental break)
Up a lazy river by the old mill run
That lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
You can linger in the shade of that fine ole tree
Throw, away your troubles, baby, dream with me
Up a lazy river where the robin's song
Wakes a brand new mornin' as we roll along
There are blue skies up above...and as long as we're in love
Up a lazy river, how happy we could be
If you go up a lazy river with me
Ah said with me now.....goin'up that... lazy river..... with me
Oh, the shark, has, pretty teeth, dear....and he shows them, pearly white
Just a jackknife, has MacHeath, yeah.....and he keeps it, out of sight
When the shark bites, with his teeth, dear....scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, though, wears MacHeath, yeah..so there's not a trace, hmmmm of red
On the sidewalk...Sunday morning, ...lies a body oozin' life
Someone's sneakin' 'round the corner...is the someone, Mack the Knife?
From a tugboat.... by the river..... a cement bag's, droopin' down
Yeah, the cement's just for the weight, dear...bet you Mack, he's back in town
Looky here Louie Miller, disappeared dear...after drawing, out his cash
And MacHeath spends, like a sailor...did our boy do, somethin' rash?
Sukey Tawdry, Jenny Diver..Lotte Lenya, Sweet Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, dears.....now that Macky's back in town
Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way
Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me
(Moon river, wider than a mile)
(I'm crossin' you in style some day)
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker

My huckleberry friend, Moon River, and me
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worries on the doorstep
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear the pitter-pat
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be complete
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade with my blues on parade
But I'm not afraid...this rover?s crossed over
If I never had a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade
Now I'm not afraid... this rover has crossed over
Now if I never made one cent

There will be goldust at my feet
On the sunny
On the sunny, sunny side of the street

Up in the mornin' 
Out on the job 
Work like the devil for my pay 
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day. 
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids 
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray 
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do 
But roll around heaven all day 
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes 
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise 
Show me that river, take me across 
Wash all my troubles away 
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do but rol around heaven all day
But roll around heaven all day 
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise 
Show me that river, take me across 
Wash all my troubles away 
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do 
But roll around heaven all day
Pardon the smile on my face my friend
Dreamin' of reachin' my journeys end
I'm headin' straight for my hearts desire
Gee, it's good to know I'm near the home fire
All of the folks that I love are there
I got a date with my favourite chair
With every step every hope grows higher
Didn't know how much I missed the home fire
The noises, the TV, the rusty old pipes
The cat always teasin' my dog
The neighbours, the quarrels, the screaming of kids
For the first time in years I'll sleep like a log
Heaven is waiting for me, my friend
Seven or eight dreams around the bend
And if you're ever in town inquire
We'll be glad to have you share the home fire
Yes, the noises, the TV, the rusty old pipes
The cat always teasin' my dog
The neighbours, the quarrels, the scream of the kids
For the first time in years I'll sleep like a log
Heaven is waiting for me, my friend
Seven or eight dreams around the bend
And if you're ever in town inquire
We'll be glad to have you share the home fire
We'll be glad to have you share the home fire
I see trees of green........ red roses too
I see 'em bloom..... for me and for you
And I think to myself.... what a wonderful world.
I see skies of blue..... clouds of white
Bright blessed days....dark sacred nights
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world.
The colors of a rainbow.....so pretty ..in the sky
Are also on the faces.....of people ..going by
I see friends shaking hands.....sayin'.. how do you do
They're really sayin'......I love you.
I hear babies cry...... I watch them grow
They'll learn much more.....than I'll never know
And I think to myself .....what a wonderful world
(instrumental break)

We are traveling in the footsteps 
Of those who've gone before 
But we'll all be reunited (But if we stand reunited) 
On a new and sunlit shore (Then a new world is in store)

When you're smilin'....keep on smilin'
The whole world smiles with you
And when you're laughin'....keep on laughin'

Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart
If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start
Take a walk
Think it over
While strolling neath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June
Ware your remark
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon,
Don't be eratic
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune
Cruel harsh words
Often spoken
Will upset your applecart
So don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
Cus, you can't lose a broken heart
No, you can't lose a broken heart!
'Bout time, 'bout time we had little taste of wasted time
Like love a deux, I wasted time alone with you
'Bout time we two we're livin' out a lovely dream come true
'Bout you, 'bout me, 'bout love, yes

'Bout time, 'bout time we spent good time with no one near
To watch me while I say a little somethin' in your ear
'Bout how I care, 'bout how I wanna make my feelin's clear
About you, 'bout me, 'bout love

We're in deep water, darlin', clear over my head
'Bout time to either sink or swim, let's swim, 'nuff said

'Bout time, 'bout time we didn't have to always steal a kiss
'Bout time, 'bout time I had my arms around your waste like this
My whole life through I wanna make you feel the way I do
'Bout you, 'bout me, 'bout love

Yes, we're in deep water, darlin', clear over my head
'Bout time to either sink or swim, let's swim, 'nuff said

'Bout time, yes time, we didn't have to always steal a kiss
'Bout time, time, I had my arms around your waste like this
My whole life through, I wanna make you feel the way I do
'Bout you, about me, 'bout us, ooo-eee
About your love and mine, budd-lee-ooo, 'bout time

Didn't he ramble...oh didn't he ramble 
He rambled till the butcher shot him down

Give me a kiss to build a dream on, 
And my imagination will thrive upon that kiss. 
Sweetheart, I ask no more than this: 
A kiss to build a dream on. 

Give me a kiss before you leave me, 
And my imagination will feed my hungry heart. 
Leave me one thing before we part, 
A kiss to build a dream on. 

When I’m alone with my fancies, I’ll be with you, 
Weaving romances, making believe they’re true. 

Give me your lips for just a moment, 
And my imagination will make that moment live. 
Give me what you alone can give, 
A kiss to build a dream on!
No one to talk with, all by myself
No one to walk with, I'm happy on the shelf babe
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

I know for certain the one I love
I'm through with flirtin', you that I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
Oh savin' my love oh baby, love for you

Like Jack Horner in a corner
Don't go nowhere and I don't care
Oh your kisses worth waitin' for, babe

I don't stay out late, don't care to go
I'm home about eight, me and my radio, babe
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' all my love for you
Come on and hear, come on and hear

Yes, all of me, why not take all of me baby
Yes, can't you see? I'm no good without you
Take my arms, I'll never use them
Take my lips, I want to lose them

Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
Why not take all of me

All of me, now please take all of me
Can't you see, I'm no good without you
Take my lips, I'd rather lose them
Take these arms, I'll never never never ever use them

Your goodbye, left me with eyes that cry
How can I, go on dear without you
You took that part, what once was my heart
So why not take all of me

Baby please take all of me
You must remember this 
A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by 
And when two lovers woo 
They still say, "I love you"
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by 
Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny 
it's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs

A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
It was such a fine spring day 
down Lou'siana way,
with fragrance divine 
and such magnificent regalia.
Oh, so fine, 
Azalea.

Oh what a lovely sight,
in red, pink and white. 
Can't held but believe 
that nothing evil can assail you. 
So naïve,
Azalea 

You're at ease on the knees 
of the moss covered trees, 
whose tops meet to make a high ceiling 
in the church-like pomp 
of the cypress swamp.
I've yet to get that same strange feeling.

I've got to go back there 
and find that blossom fair
I always dream of.
'Cause with you who could be a failure? 
My first love, 
Azalea
I really can't stay
(But baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away
(But baby, it's cold outside)

This evening has been
(Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice
(I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)

So really I'd better scurry
(Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more
(Put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think
(Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink?
(No cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how
(Your eyes are like starlight)
To break this spell
(I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say no, no, no, sir
(Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the sense in hurting my pride?)

I really can't stay
(Baby, don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside

I simply must go
(But baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no
(But baby, it's cold outside)

This welcome has been
(How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm
(Look out the window at that storm)

My sister will be suspicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
(Waves upon a tropical shore)

My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
(Ooh, your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more
(Never such a blizzard before)

I've got to get home
(But baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
(It's up to your knees out there)

You've really been grand
(I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see
(How can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think of my life long sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied
(If you caught pneumonia and died)

I really can't stay
(Get over that hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside
I had a woman
Livin' way back o' town
Yeah she treated me right
Never let me down
But I wasn't satisfied
I had to run around

Now she's gone and left me
I'm worried as can be
Oh I've searched this world all over
Wonderin' where she could be
I would ask that she forgive me
And maybe she'll come back to me

(But I doubt it)

I'm lonesome an blue
And I've learned a thing or two
Oh fellas here's a tip
I'm gonna pass on down to you
Never mistreat your woman
Cause it's gonna bounce right back on you
Now won't you come along with me
To the Mississippi?
We'll take a trip to the land of dreams
Blowing down the river, down to New Orleans

The band is there to meet us
Old friends to greet us
That's where the line and the dark folks meet
A heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street

I said, Basin Street, Basin Street
Where the elite always meet
Down in New Orleans, the land of dreams
You'll never know how nice it seems

Or just how much it really means
Just to be, yes, siree, in New Orleans
The land of dreams where I can lose
My Basin Street blues

Now, you're glad you came with me
Down the Mississippi
We took a trip in a land of dreams
And floated down the river down to New Orleans

Where to, Basin Street, Basin Street
Where the elite always meet
Down in New Orleans, the land of dreams
You'll never know how, how much it seems

Or just how much it really means
Just to be, yes, siree, yeah, New Orleans
The land of dreams where I can lose
My Basin Street blues
Bessie couldn’t help it
Bessie couldn’t help it

Bessie couldn’t help it any more
Than you could or I could
Bessie couldn’t help it though she tried to be good
Oh, so good

She was pretty as the heaven's above
Oh, boy but how she could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful, terrible
But Bessie couldn’t help it any more
Than you could or I could

When she smiled you were bound to fall, that’s all
A boy kissed Bessie in the parlor one night
Why, oh, why did she yell with delight?
‘Cause Bessie couldn’t help it any more
Than you could or I could

Aww, dum pe dum, now people listen
Bessie couldn’t help it any more
Than you could or I could
No, Bessie couldn’t help it though she tried to be good
Oh, so good

She was pretty as the heavens above
And oh, boy how that girl could love
Bessie had affection that was simply wonderful
Bop, bop be de oww
Bessie couldn’t help it any more
Than you could or I could

Now when she smiled you were bound to fall, that’s all boy
Boy kissed Bessie in the street one night
My oh, my, how she yelled with delight
Bessie couldn’t help it any more
Than you could or I could
Won't you come home, bill bailey, won't you come home
I've moaned the whole night long
I'll do the cookin', honey, I'll pay the rent
I know I done you wrong

You remember that rainy evenin'
I threw you out....with nothin' but a fine tooth comb
Ya, I know I'm to blame, now... ain't it a shame
Bill bailey, won't you please come home

Won't you come home, bill bailey, won't you come on home
I've moaned that whole day long
I'll do all the cookin' honey, I'll even pay the rent
I know, that I have done you, oh so, wrong

You remember that rainy evenin'
I throwed you out, with nothin but a fine tooth comb
I know I'm to blame, now... ain't it a shame
So baby, won't you please come

I said now, won't you please come

Bill bailey, won't you please.... come on home
Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Feels like ol' Ned wished I was dead
What did I do to be so black and blue

Even the mouse ran from my house
They laugh at you and scorn you too
What did I do to be so black and blue

I'm white inside but that don't help my case
'Cause I can't hide what is in my face

How would it end, ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue

How would it end, ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue
Blue again, blue again
And you darn well it's you again
You said last night we were through again
And now I'm blue again

I'm alone again, alone again
I'm out around on my own again
There's a mocking bird that's flown again
And I'm alone again

Now baby, though I said I hate you
I love you more everyday, babe
Though I aggravate you
All that I'm dyin' to say that it's new again

You again and we'll meet today
At half past two again
And tonight we'll fight again
And I'll be blue again
Blue skies, smilin' at me
Nothin' but blues skies do I see
Bluebirds singing a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things lookin' so right
Noticin' the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, my how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things lookin' so right
Noticin' the days hurryin' by
When you're in love, oh how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
Now she wants a butter & egg man
From way out in the West
She wants somebody who's workin' all day
So she's got money when she wants to play

Now pretty clothes, they'll never be mine
But what she told me the other day
I hope she don't change her mind

Now she wants a butter & egg man
A great big butter & egg man
From way down South
Cake walkers may come, cake walkers may go,
but I wanna tell you 'bout a couple I know
High steppin' pair, Debonair
When it comes for bus'ness not a soul can compare

Here they come, look at 'em, demonstratin',
goin' some, ain't they syncopatin'?
Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down
Dancin' fools ain't they demonstratin'?
They're a class of their own

Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,
you may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em
Strut your stuff, they're the cake walkin' babies from home
Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home

Here they come, look at 'em, syncopatin',
goin' some, ain't they demonstratin'?
Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em down
Dancin' fools ain't they syncopatin'2?
They're a class of their own

Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,
you may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em
Strut your stuff, they're the cake walkin' babies form home
Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home
Carry me back to old Virginny
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime
There's where the old darke'ys heart am long'd to go
There's where I labored so hard for old massa
Day after day in the field of yellow corn
No place on earth do I love more sincerely
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born

Carry me back to old Virginny
There's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow
There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime
There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go 

Carry me back to old Virginny
There let me live 'till I wither and decay
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered
There's where this old darke'ys life will pass away
Massa and missis have long gone before me
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

It's heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seems to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Now Mamma, dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through

It's heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I'd love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Come on, and dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to heaven

I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Yes, dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through to heaven

I'm in heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Cheek to cheek
Cheek to cheek
Cheek to cheek
Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey

Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
A sweep is as lucky, as lucky can be
Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-oo!
Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

Or blow me a kiss and that’s lucky too

Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey

Now, as the ladder of life has been strung
You may think a sweep’s on the bottommost rung
Though I spend my time in the ashes and that hm-hmm
In this whole wide world there’s no happier cat

Chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim-in-ey

I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do
A broom for the shaft and a brush for the flute
Though I’m covered in soot from my head to my toe
A sweep knows he’s welcome where’er he goes

Chim chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim chim chim-in-ey, chim chim chim chim-in-ey

Chim chim-in-ey, chim chim-in-ey
Chim chim cher-ee!
’en you’re with a sweep, you’re in good com’any
Nowhere there’s a more happy crew
Than them that sings chim cham chim cher-oo

Chim-in-ey chim-ee cher-oo chim-cher-ee!

Chim chim chim chim-in-ey
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans?
I miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's gettin' stronger
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss covered vines, the tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds used to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
Hurryin' into spring

The Mardi Gras, the memories
Of Creole's tunes that fills the air
I dream of old [unverified] in June
And soon I'm wishin' that I were there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where I left my heart?
And there's something more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans
Magnolia trees at night
Sparkling bright
Fields of cotton look wintery white
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

A barefoot choir in prayer
Fills the air
Mississippi folks
Are gathering there
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

You'll see a dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

You'll see
A dixieland Santa Claus
Leading the band
To a good old Creole beat
And golly what a spirit
You can only hear it
Down on Basin Street
Your cares will disappear
When you hear
Hallelujah old St. Nicholas is here
When it's Christmas time
In New Orleans

When it's Christmas time in
It's Christmas time in in New Orleans
From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright

He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the girls and boys
So dig, Santa comes on big

He'll come a callin' when the snow's the most
When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when Old Saint Nick
[Incomprehensible] a lick on the peppermint stick

He'll come a flyin' from a higher place
And fill the stocking by the fireplace
So you'll have a yule that's cool

Yeah, from Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip
Tonight, while the moon is bright

He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys
To give the groanies of the girls and boys
So dig, Santa comes on big

Come a callin' when the snow's the most
Cats are sleepin' warm as toast
And you gonna flip when the Old Saint Nick
[Incomprehensible] a lick on the peppermint stick

He'll come a flyin' from the higher place
Fill the stockings by the fireplace
So you'll have a yule that's cool

Have a yule that's cool
Yeah, cool yule
When your money's gone
Friends have turned you down
And you wander 'round
Just like a hound
(A lonesome houn')

Then you stop to say
"Let me go away from this old town
(This awful town)

There's a place I know
Folks won't pass me by
Dallas, Texas, that's the town
I cry
(Oh, hear me cry)

And I'm going back
Going back to stay there 'til I die
(Until I die)

I've got the Dallas blues
And the Main Street heart disease
(It's buzzin' 'round)

I've got the Dallas blues
And the Main Street heart disease
(It's buzzin' 'round)

Buzzin' 'round my head
Like a swarm of little honey bees
(Of honey bees)

When I got up north
Clothes I had to spare
Sold 'em all to pay my railroad fare
(My railroad fare)

Just to come back there
Ridin' in a Pullman parlor chair
(A parlor chair)

Sent a telegram, this is what I said
"Baby, bring a cold towel for my head
(My achin' head)

Got the Dallas blues
And your lovin' man is almost dead
(Is almost dead)

I'm goin' put myself on a Santa Fe and go
(I'm goin' to go)
I'm goin' to put myself on a Santa Fe and go
(I'm goin' to go)

To that Texas town
Where you never see the ice and snow
(The ice and the snow)
Didn't it rain, children?
Talk about rain, oh, my Lord
Didn't it fall, didn't it fall?
Didn't it fall, my Lord, didn't it rain?

Oh, it rained forty days
And it rained forty nights
There was no land nowhere in sight
God, send the angel to spread the news

He hastes his wings and away he flew
To the East to the West
To the North to the South
All day all night

How it rained, how it rained
Didn't it rain, children?
Talk about rain, oh, my Lord
Didn't it fall, didn't it fall?

Didn't it fall, my Lord, didn't it rain?
Some at the window, some at the door
Some said, "Noah, can't you take a little more?"
"No, no," said Noah, "no, no, my friends"

The nature got to keep; you can't get in
I told you, I told you a long time ago
You wouldn't hear me; you disobey me
Lord, send the angel a warning to you

It began to rain and now you are through
Well, it rained forty days
Forty nights without stopping
Noah was glad

When the rain stopped dropping
Knock at the window, knock at the door
Come on, brother Noah
Can't you take little more?

No, no, my brothers, you are full of sin
God has the key; you can't get in
Would you listen? how it rained
Didn't it rain, children?

Talk about rain, oh, my Lord
Didn't it fall, didn't it fall?
Didn't it fall, my Lord, didn't it rain?
Out on the plains, down near Santa Fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along, I heard him singin'
A most peculiar cowboy song

It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah

Now get along, get hip, little dogies
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip, little dogies
He trucked 'em on down that old fairway

Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah

Now singin' his cowboy songs, he's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a Dixie touch
He was raised on Loco weed
He's what you call a swing in half breed

Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah, playboy

Singin' his cowboy songs, he's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a Dixie touch
He was raised on Loco weed
He's what you call a swing half breed

Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah

Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Comma ti yi yi yeah, comma ti yippity yi yeah
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dream
Is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words of everyone you've heard
I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal
How I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memories
And other's arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothing till you hear it from me
And you never will

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seams of anyone's dream
Mama, it's over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the words of others you've heard
Mama, I haven't a chance

True, I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart, yes, the words in my heart reveal
How I feel about

Some kiss may cloud my memories
And other's arms may hold a thrill
Please do nothing till you hear it from me
Mama, you never will
Man, do you know what it means to miss New Orleans

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I’m not wrong, this feeling's gettin' stronger
The longer, I stay away

Miss them moss covered vines, the tall sugar pines
Where mockin' birds used to sing
And I'd like to see that lazy Mississippi
Hurryin' into spring

Oh the moonlight on the bayou
A creole tune that fills the air
I dream about Magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
Since that's where you left your heart
And there's something more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans
Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
Yes, they'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Yes darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless why stir up on memories

Been invited on dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

Yeah da di de
Heard they crowded the floor, baby
Don't get around much anymore, baby
I thought I'd visit the club
And got as far as the door
They'd have asked me about you
Don't get around much anymore

Oh darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
Yes but nevertheless why stir up on memories

Been invited to dates
Might have gone but what for
Awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

From a dummy than I get from you
Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

People stoppin', starin'
I can't see the faces
Only the shadows of the eyes

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'
Through the pourin' rain
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes
Bankin' off the northeast wind
Sailin' on a summer breeze
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear the word they're sayin'
Only the echoes of my mind

And I won't let you leave my love behind
No, baby, I won't let you leave my love behind
And I won't let you leave my love behind

And the little wheel run by faith
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
A wheel in a wheel
Way up in the middle of the air

There's one thing sure that you can't do
Way in the middle of the air
You can't serve God and Satan too
Way in the middle of the air

Ezekiel saw the wheel
Way up in the middle of the air
Ezekiel saw the wheel
Way up in the middle of the air
And the little wheel run by faith
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
A wheel in a wheel
Way up in the middle of the air

One of these days about twelve o'clock
Way in the middle of the air
This old world's gonna reel and rock
Way in the middle of the air

Ezekiel saw the wheel
Way up in the middle of the air
Ezekiel saw the wheel
Way up in the middle of the air
And the little wheel run by faith
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
A wheel in a wheel
Way up in the middle of the air

Ezekiel saw the wheel
Within a wheel in a wheel my lord
wheel wheel in a wheel 
within in a wheel in a wheel great god o mighty
wheel wheel in a wheel
Within a wheel in a wheel my lord
Ezekiel saw the wheel!
You look at me and then a song begins
Played on a million velvet violins
My head goes reelin' and around it spins
Fantastic, fantastic that's you, yes

You whisper darlin' and before my eyes
A blaze of fireworks light up the skies
My heart grows wings then away it flies
Fantastic, fantastic that's you

You perform miracles
Whenever you hold me near
Tender, warm miracles
That make me surrender dear, yes

And when you kiss me heaven opens wide
And there you are inviting me inside
No wonder angels up there have staring eyes
Fantastic, fantastic that's you

Yes, and when you kiss me heaven opens wide
And there you are inviting me inside
No wonder angels up there have staring eyes
Fantastic, fantastic that's you
Give me your kisses, I'll give you my heart
Give me your promise that we'll never part
I'll give you love and devotion
High as the sky above, deeper than the deepest ocean

Give me the right to call you all mine
And I'll be true till the ending of time
Give me your kisses, I'm willing to start
And I'll give you my heart

Give me the right to call you all mine
And I'll be true till the ending of time
Give me your kisses, I'm willing to start
And I'll give you my heart
Got a bran' new suit

Got a bran' new twinkle in my eye
Do you know the reason why?

Got a bran' new girl
An' I won't dispute
She's the reason why I got a bran' new tie
An' a bran' new suit

When I'm with her
Gotta look my best
Put on my tan shoes
Gray spats, double breasted vest

Gonna wear my stickpin, a Tecla Pearl
With a bran' new tie
An' a bran' new suit
A bran' new girl
A man wants to work for his pay
A man wants a place in the sun
A man wants a gal proud to say
That she'll become his lovin' wife
He wants a chance to give his kids a better life
Well hello, hello, hello brother

You can travel all around the world and back
You can fly or sail or ride a railroad track
But no matter where you go you're gonna find
That people have the same things on their minds

A man wants to work for his pay
A man wants a place in the sun
A man wants a gal proud to say

Hello central, what's the matter with this line?
I wanna talk to that high brown of mine
Tell me how long will I have to wait
Please give me two ninety eight, why do you hesitate?

Oh, what you say, can't talk to my brown?
A storm last night blowed the wires all down
Now, tell me how long will I have to wait
Oh, won't you tell me now, why do you hesitate?

Say, Sunday night, my beau proposed to me
Said, he'd be happy if his wife I'd be
Said he, "How long, baby, will I have to wait?"
Come be my wife, my Kate, why do you hesitate?

Say, I declined him, it was just for a stall
He left that night on the cannonball
Honey, oh honey, how long, will I have to wait?
Oh, won't you tell me now, baby, why do you hesitate?

Say, I have no use for other sweets of any kind
Baby since the day you came around
But from the start I instantly made up my mind
No sweeter sweetness can be found

You so sweet, oh Pops!
Can't be beat, you mean it!
Nothing sweeter ever stood on feet, yes

Every honeybee fills with jealousy
When they see you out with me
I don't blame them goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose

When you're passin' by flowers droop and sigh
And I know the reason why
You're much sweeter goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose

Say Pop say, don't buy sugar
You just have to touch my cup
You're my sugar
It's sweet when you stir it up

Said, when I'm taking sips from your tasty lips
Seems the honey fairly drips
You're confection goodness knows
Honeysuckle rose
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I'm plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while, baby
You're sure to find happiness and I guess
All those things that you've pined for

Gee, I'd like to see you lookin' swell, baby
Diamond bracelets, woolworths doesn't sell, baby
Till that lucky day, lucky day you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
Never treat me sweet and gentle
The way she should
'Cause I got it bad, and that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
And it's not made of wood
Now, I got it bad and that ain't good

When the weekend's over
And Monday rolls around
I end up like start out
Just crying my heart out

She don't love me like I love her
Nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good

Now when the weekend's over
Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out
Just crying

Oh, she don't love me like I love her
Nobody could
I got it bad and it sure is good
Yes, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart
I get some consolation when I read
Of someone else's lonely heart, yes

I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Until you in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home, yes

I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Like I've been doin' ever since we've been apart, yes
I get some consolation when I read
Of someone else's lonely heart

I wonder if you get the papers too
And if you feel as melancholy as I do
Baby, till you in my arms again, never more to roam
I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Babe, I guess I'll get the papers and go home
Dear Dolly
I still get jealous
When they look at you
I may not show it, but I do

It's more than I can bear
When they start to stare
'Cause they think
You're too good to be true

I still get jealous
When we kiss goodnight
Unless you hold me
Extra tight

And dear, I know a secret
You didn't know I knew
I still get jealous
'Cause it pleases you

And dear, I know a secret
You didn't know I knew
I still get jealous
'Cause it pleases you

Mama and Dolly, I know a secret
You didn't know, I knew
I still get jealous, honey
Very jealous

I still get jealous
'Cause it pleases you
I'll see you in my dreams
And then I'll hold you in my dreams
Someone took you right out of my arms
Still I feel the thrill of your charms

Lips that once were mine
Tender eyes that shine
They will light my way tonight
I'll see you in my dreams

Yes, I will see you in my dreams
You know I'll hold you in my dreams
I know that someone took you right out of my arms
But still I feel the thrill of your charms

I dream of lips that once were mine
And those tender eyes that shine
I know they'll light my way tonight
When I see you in my dreams

Yes, they will light my way tonight
Because I'll see you in my dreams
As I walk down the street
Seems everyone I meet
Gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

The birds in every tree
Are all so neighborly
They sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

If you should ask me the amount
In my bank account
I'd have to confess that I'm slippin'
But that don't worry me, confidentially
I've got a dream that's a-pippin'

And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
A home where love waits, I know
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

I'm just a lucky, lucky so and so
Baby, baby
I wanna be with you tonight

If I could be with you, I'd love you strong
If I could be with you, I'd love you long
I want you to know that I wouldn't go
Until I told you honey why I love you so

If I could be with you, one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things I might, things I might
I'm telling you true, I'd be anything but blue
If I could be with you, hmm babe
If I could be with you
In a mellow tone, feeling fancy free
And I'm not alone, I've got company
Everything's okay, the live-long day
With this mellow song, I can't go wrong

In a mellow tone, that's the way to live
If you mope and groan, something's gotta give
Just go your way and laugh and play
You know there's joy unknown in a mellow tone

In [?] a mellow tone that's the way to live
If you mope and groan, something's got to give
Just go your way and laugh and play
You know there's joy unknown in a mellow tone

Just go your way and laugh and play
You know there's joy unknown in a mellow tone
In a mellow tone
In the shade of the old apple tree
When the love in your eyes I could see
When the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird
Seemed to whisper sweet music to me

I could hear the dull buzz of the bee
In the blossoms as you said to me
With a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you
In the shade of the old apple tree

In the shade of old apple tree
(Apple tree)
When the love in your eyes I could see
(I could see)
Mama, when the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird
Seemed to whisper sweet music to me
(Music to me)

I could hear the dull buzz of the bee
(Buzz of the bee)
In the blossoms as you said to me
(Said to me)
Mama, with a heart that is true, I'll be waiting for you
Yes, shade of the old apple tree
I have always been a wand'rer 
Over land and sea 
Yet a moonbeam on the water 
Casts a spell o'er me 
A vision fair I see 
Again I seem to be

Back home again in Indiana, 
And it seems that I can see 
The gleaming candlelight, still burning bright, 
Through the sycamores for me. 
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance 
Through the fields I used to roam. 
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash, 
How I long for my Indiana home.

Fancy paints on mem'ry's canvas 
Scenes that we hold dear 
We recall them in days after 
Clearly they appear 
And often times I see 
A scene that's dear to me 

Back home again in Indiana, 
And it seems that I can see 
The gleaming candlelight, still burning bright, 
Through the sycamores for me. 
The new-mown hay sends all its fragrance 
Through the fields I used to roam. 
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash, 
How I long for my Indiana home.
What good is melody, what good is music
If it ain't possessin' something sweet?
Nah, it ain't the melody and it ain't the music
There's something else that makes this tune complete

Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Well, it don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you got

Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing
I said, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Nah, it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you got
Don't mean a thing, boy, if it ain't that a swing
Kiss me once and kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since I can't remember when
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

Oh, kiss me once and kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long such, a long time
I haven't felt like this my dear
Since I don't remember when
It's been a long been a mighty long time

You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you
Or how empty they all seem without you
So kiss me once and kiss me twice
And kiss me once again
It's been a long long time

It's been a mighty, mighty long time
Jonah was a man who got a word from the Lord
“Go and preach the Gospel to the sinful land"
But he got on a ship and he tried to get away
And he ran into a storm in the middle of the sea

Now the Lord, He made the waves just roll so high
The ship begin to sink and they all begin to cry
So they pulled ole Jonah out of the hole
And they jumped him in the water just to lighten up the load

Now the Lord made a whale, long and wide
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And he swallowed up Jonah, hair and hide
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Now Jonah started to pray in the belly of the whale
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
He repented of his sins like a man in jail
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Now Jonah must o’ been a bad man, he must o’ been a sinner
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
'Cos when the whale got him down, he didn’t like his dinner
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Well, he swum around the ocean, sick as he could be
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And after three days, whoops, he had to set him free
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish, mmm

So the whale spit Jonah out onto dry land
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
And he went on to preaching like a righteous man
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish

Then the people quit their sins when they heard him in the town
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish
So when you hear the call, don’t you turn the Gospel down
Lord, Lord waddnat a fish, mmm
Keepin' out of mischief now
I really am in love and how
I'm through playin' with fire
It's you whom I desire

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me
I have told them in advance
They can't break up our romance
Livin' up to all my vows
'Cause I'm keepin' out mischief now

Keepin' out of mischief now
I really am in love and how
I'm through playin' with fire
It's you whom I desire

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me

They can't break up our romance
Livin' up to all my vows
'Cause I'm keepin' out mischief

Oh, yeah
Keepin' out of mischief
Oh, yeah
Keepin' out of mischief now
Last night I dreamed of you
Of your dear smile and eyes all blue
If only my dreams come true
I'll be so glad my whole life through

Last night I was dreaming
I dreamed that that you kissed me
While bright stars were beaming
I dreamed that you kissed me

When I awoke with the break of dawn
Oh, I longed to go dreaming on
You had gone far while I was dreaming
I dreamed that you kissed me

And I awoke with the break of dawn
Oh, I longed to go dreaming on
You had gone far while I was dreaming
I dreamed that you kissed me
Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun
How you 'spect to get your day's work done?
You can't get your day's work done
Sleepin' in the noon day sun

Lazybones, layin' in the shade
How you gonna get your cornmeal made?
You can't get no cornmeal made
Sleepin' in that evening shade

When taters need sprayin',
I bet you keep prayin'
The bugs'll fall off of the vine

And when you go fishin'
I bet you keep wishin'
Them fish don't grab your line

Lazybones, loafin' all the day
How you 'spect to make a dime that way?
You won't make no dime that way
Loafin' in the shade all day
When the little blue birds
Who have never said a word
Start to say spring spring
When the little blue bell
In the bottom of the dell
Starts to ring ding ding
When the little blue clerk
In the middle of its work
Starts to tune to the moon up above
It is nature that's simpling telling us to fall in love....
Oh, yes and that's why...

Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

In Spain the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it
Just think of the Siamese twins
Some Argentines, without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

Romantic sponges they say do it
Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Cold Cape Cod clams, 'gainst their wish, do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it
Waiter, bring me shadroe
In shallow shoals, English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it
Let's fall in love...

Dragonflies in the reeds do it
Sentimental centipedes do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Mosquitoes, heaven forbid, do it
So does every katydid do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

The most refined ladybug do it
When a gentleman calls
Moths in your rugs do it
Well let me ask, what's the use of balls?

Locusts in the trees do it
Why, even the bees do it
Even all educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love...

I said
The chimpanzees in the zoo do it
Some courageous kangaroos do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...
Oh, fall in love...

I'm sure that girafes on the slide do it
Every hippopotami do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...

Oh, sloths who hang down from the twigs do it
Though the effort is great
Yes, sweet guinea pigs do it
Buy a couple and wait

Now the world admits bears in the pits do it
Even pekigneses in the Ritz do it
Let's do it
Mama, let's fall in love...
Pops, did you hear the story of long John Dean?
Not yet drummer
A bold bank robber from Bowlin' Green
Was sent to the jail house yesterday
But late last night he made his getaway

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

Long John stood on the railroad tie
Waitin' for freight train to come by
Freight train came by puffin' and flyin'
Oughta seen long John grabbin' that blind

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
Long gone John from Bowlin' Green

They caught him in Frisco to seal his fate
At San Quentin they jailed him one evening late
But out on the ocean, John did escape
'Cause the guards forgot to close the Golden Gate

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

While they offered a reward to bring him back
Even put bloodhounds on his track
Those doggone bloodhounds lost his scent
Now nobody knows where John went

He was long gone from Kentucky
Long gone, ain't he lucky?
Long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

A gang of men tried to capture Dean
So they chased him with a submarine
Dean jumped overboard and grabbed the submarine
And made that gang catch a flyin' machine

He's long gone from Kentucky
A long gone, that boy's lucky?
A long gone, what I mean
A long gone John from Bowlin' Green

He's long gone, I said from Kentucky
Long gone, hmm that boy's lucky
Long gone, yeah he's got nothing in the head
Long gone, long gone
I'm lyin' to myself, cryin' to myself
Tryin' to make believe my baby's on the shelf
But it's more than I can do
Tryin' to find a way to bluff it through
I miss my lovin' and kissin'

When I hear the radio playin' "I Love You So"
That's the time, you know, I start to feel like ten below
I'm lyin' to myself
Tryin' to chase the blues away

Just because of foolish pride I tried to hide
All feeling's for Cupid's art
And though I've cried out loud that two's a crowd
That don't convince my heart

When I think of my sweet pet and the places we met
I tell myself I'm not a doggone bit upset
But I'm lyin' to myself,
Tryin' to chase the blues away
You coax the blues right out of the horn, Mame
You charm the husk right off of the corn, Mame

You've got the banjoes strummin' and plunkin' out
A tune to beat the band
The whole plantation's hummin' since you brought
Dixie back to Dixieland

You make your Louis feel like the king, Mame
You make the world, we're living in swing, Mame

You make the old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention of your name
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational
I think you're just sensational, Mame

Mame
Mame

Yes, you make your Satchmo feel like a king, Mame
You make the world we're living in swing, Mame

You make the old magnolia tree
Blossom at the mention of your name
Your special fascination'll prove to be inspirational
I think you're just sensational

Yea, sensational, you sensational, Mame
Mame, Mame, Mame
Mandy! Mandy! 
Make up your mind!
Preacher man is handy, 
Mandy, easy to find.
Marching down the aisle with you, 
we'll make them all stare.
With a little Black-Eyed Susan 
stuck in your hair.
Mandy, Mandy, 
won't you decide?
Everything is dandy,
Mandy, once you are my bride.
In a year or two 
there may be three of a kind!
Listen to me, Mandy, 
make up your mind!
Even though the weight was heavy
I was happy under levy
Wanna take my ride for place
In the Mississippi Basin back home
Where I did at home

Everybody was for me there
All the folks work on and free there
Used to love to wash my face
In that Mississippi Basin back home

There goes summer land
That's the song I'm singing all day
Even something, baby
Why did I leave you, why did I go away

Soon I'm gonna make a bee line
But an old place for me and
Way across the basin, dig line
That Mississippi Basin back home
You ain't been blue, no, no, no
You ain't been blue till you've had that mood indigo
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I sit and sigh, go 'long blues

Always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
In the evenin' when lights are low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

'Cause there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a soul who's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die
Well, there'll be peace and there's something on Christmas day
No more hunger, no more war
Check out this single day

Yes well, there'll be happiness someday on Christmas day
All those win brothers and sisters
Just one single day

People fight for their gods
Die for their beliefs
Christians, Jews, and Muslims too
They knew not what they knew

Oh, well there'll be no more congress
No more religions too
And there will be peace on earth
But no more Christmas too
Oh, yes.
Nobody knows the way I feel
This morning, this morning
Nobody knows the way I feel
This morning, this morning

If I'd only had my way
The graveyard would be the place
My man would lay
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning

I feel like I could scream and cry
This morning, this morning
I feel like I could scream and cry
This morning, this morning

I feel like I could scream and cry
I'm true out on it or I'd rather die
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning

I even hate to hear your name
This morning, this morning
I even hate to hear your name
This morning, this morning

I even hate to hear your name
I could kill you and take a brown eyed express train
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
Now once there lived an old man with a very crooked nose
He lived in log hut and they called him old man Mose, yeah
Early one mornin' I knocked at his door
Didn't hear a single sound, I ain't gonna do it no more

'Cause I believe old man, I believe old man
I believe old man, that old man Mose is dead
I'm tellin' you, I believe old man, I believe old man
I do believe old man, that old man Mose is dead

Now, we believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe he's dead, oh we believe

We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe Mose kicked the bucket
We believe he's dead, I'm lookin' here

I went around to the side and I peeped through the crack
I saw an old man layin' flat on his back, yeah
If old man Mose was dead asleep, I did not know
But after lookin' through that window, I ain't gonna do that no more

'Cause I found out old man, I found out old man
I found out old man, that old man Mose is dead
I'm tellin' you, I found out old man, what it's all about, old man
I found out old man, that old man Mose is dead

Now, we found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out he's dead, oh

We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out Mose kicked the bucket
We found out he's dead

Old man Mose is dead

I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town

If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
If I feel tomorrow like I feel today
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway

Oh, that St. Louis woman with her diamond rings
She pulls my man around by her apron strings
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere

I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord

I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I got those St. Louis blues
I got the blues, I got the blues, I got the blues
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord
There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the trombone
And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the clarinet
And he told everybody “when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

But the children of Israel would not bow down! 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol! 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
I said you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it oughtta be! 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

Well they couldn't burn a hair on the head of 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Laughin’ and talkin' while the fire jumpin’ round 
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

Old Nebudchanezzer called "hey there!
When he saw the power of the Lord
And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon
Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!
Oh, Abednego!!
Now look here don't be singin' that pretty music for me
I've learned my lesson and I ain't ready to go yet
Let me tell you all about it

I dreamed last night I got on the boat to Heaven
And by some chance I had brought my dice along
And there I stood, and I hollered, "Someone fade me"
But the passengers they knew right from wrong

For the people all said
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"
And the people all said
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"

"And the devil will drag you under
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rocking the boat"

Now I sailed away on that little boat to Heaven
And by some chance found a bottle in my fist
And there I stood nicely passin' out the whiskey
But the passengers were bound to resist

For the people all said
"Beware, you are on a heavenly trip"
People all said
"Beware, beware you'll scuttle the ship"

"And the devil will drag you under
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat"

Now as I laughed at those passengers to Heaven
A great big wave came and washed me overboard
And as I sank, and I hollered, "Someone save me"
That's the moment I woke up, thank the Lord

And I said to myself
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"
I said to myself
"Sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat"

"And the devil will drag you under
With a soul so heavy you'd never float
Sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat"
Sit down you're rockin' the boat

Sit down you're rockin' the boat
And I ain't gonna rock it no more
In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere, I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude I'm praying
Dear Lord above, send back my love
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child

(Sometimes)
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child

A long way is from home
A long way is from home
Do believe us, A long ways from home
A long ways from home

Yes, sometimes I feel like a motherless child
(Why?)
Why? 'Cause nothin' ever happens
(Nothin'?)

Well nothin' good
(So what's good?)
You know to have a ball, man
(You sick?)
No

(Hungry?)
No man
I just had myself a whole mess of black eyed peas and rice
(Long way, long way)

(See what I mean?)
I did I am a long ways from home
But things could be worse, sure could
I went down to St.James Infirmary
Saw my baby there
Sat down on a long white table
So sweet, so cold, so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She can look this wide world over
She'll never find a sweet man like me

When I die I want you to dress me in straight lace shoes
Boxback coat and a Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So the boys’ll know that I died standin' pat
Sometimes, I wonder why I spend
Such lonely nights
Oh baby, lonely nights

Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

When our love was new, oh baby
And each kiss, an inspiration
Now that baby, you know was long ago

Oh, beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise, where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain

In my heart, it will remain, baby
My stardust melody
Oh memory, oh memory, oh memory
Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Yo' daddy's rich and yo' mama's good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of these mornin's you gonna rise up singin'
You gonna spread your little wings and you'll take to the sky
But 'till that mornin' there ain't nothin' gonna harm you
With yo mama and daddy standin' bye

Now it's summertime and the livin' is easy
Them fish are jumpin' and the cotton's 'bout waist high
Yo' daddy's rich and, ya know yo' mama's good lookin'
Now hush little baby, don't you cry

Summertime
Ah, said it's summertime
Sunset stomp got folks jumpin’
Sunset stomp got folks
Jumpin' up and down, all around
They yell, band men play some more

Charleston, Charleston
I’ll say it's hot
But your black bottom, it’s got ‘em
But, oh, that sunset stomp

Lord, it’s going
And the people strain
Created in the crazy house
It sets good folks insane

Gentlemen, ladies too
Push 'em round n round
They loose their head
They’ll drop dead

Doin’ that sunset stomp
I said, doin' sunset stomp
I’ve just found joy
I’m as happy as a baby boy
With another brand new choo-choo toy
When I’m with my sweet Lorraine

A pair of eyes
That are bluer than the summer skies
When you see them you will realize
Why I love my sweet Lorraine

I'm so happy when it's raining, I don’t miss the sun
For it’s in my sweetie’s smile
Just to think that I’m the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle, yes

Each night I pray
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can’t wait until that happy day
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Yes when it's raining, I don’t miss the sun
For it’s in my sweetie’s smile, baby
Just to think that I’m the lucky one
Who will lead her down the aisle

Yeah, each night I pray, yes
That nobody steals her heart away
Just can’t wait until the lucky day
When I marry sweet Lorraine, yes

When the lucky day, yeah
When I marry sweet Lorraine
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

I looked over Jordan, and what did I see
Comin' for to carry me home
A band of angels comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Just tell my friends that I'm a comin' too
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

I'm sometimes up and sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But still my soul feels heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

I look over Jordan, and what do I see
Comin' for to carry me home
A band of angels comin' after me
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Oh, I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
Why, the moment that you passed by I got a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

And once again, I seem to get that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart

Yes, I saw you last night, Fats, yeah
And got that old feeling, oh, you did, heh heh
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling, ah, heh

From the moment that you passed by
I didn't pass, I stopped, I got a thrill
You did, hey, hey and when you caught my eye
My little heart stood still

And once again, I seem to get that old yearning
Then I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart
To spend one night with you
In our old rendezvous
And reminisce with you
That's my desire

To be where gypsies play
Down in that ole cafe
We'll dance till break of day
That's my desire

We'll sip a little glass of wine
I'll gaze into your eyes divine
I'll feel the touch of your lips
Pressing on mine

To hear you whisper low
Just when it's time to go
Darling, I love you, so
That's my desire

To hear you whisper low
Doggone you know it's time to go
Darling, I love you so
You're my desire

Though you found someone new
I'll always love you
That's my desire
Born on a mountain top in Tennessee
Greenest state in the land of the free
Raised in the woods so he knew ev'ry tree
Kilt him a b'ar when he was only three
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

In eighteen thirteen the Creeks uprose
Addin' redskin arrows to the country's woes
Now, Injun fightin' is somethin' he knows
So he shoulders his rifle an' off he goes
Davy, Davy Crockett, the man who don't know fear

Off through the woods he's a-marchin' along
Makin' up yarns an' a-singin' a song
Itchin' fer fightin' an' rightin' a wrong
He's ringy as a b'ar an' twict as strong
Davy, Davy Crockett, the buckskin buccaneer

Andy Jackson is our gen'ral's name
His reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame
Them redskin varmints us volunteers'll tame
'Cause we got the guns with the sure-fire aim
Davy, Davy Crockett, the champion of us all

Headed back to war from the ol' home place
But Red Stick was leadin' a merry chase
Fightin' an' burnin' at a devil's pace
South to the swamps on the Florida Trace
Davy, Davy Crockett, trackin' the redskins down

Fought single-handed through the Injun War
Till the Creeks was whipped an' peace was in store
An' while he was handlin' this risky chore
Made himself a legend for evermore
Davy, Davy Crockett, king of the wild frontier

He give his word an' he give his hand
That his Injun friends could keep their land
An' the rest of his life he took the stand
That justice was due every redskin band
Davy, Davy Crockett, holdin' his promise dear

Home fer the winter with his family
Happy as squirrels in the olc1
Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your strife
I mean the bare necessities
Of mother nature's recipies
That bring the bare necessities of life

Wherever I wander, wherever I roam
I can't be fonder of my big home
The bees are buzzing in the trees
To make some honey just for me

You look under the rocks and plants
And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few
The bare necessities of life will come to you

Look for the bare necessities
The simple bare necessities
Forget about your worries and your stife
I mean the bare necessities
That's why a bear can rest at ease
With just the bare necessities of life

So just relax, yeah
In my backyard
If you act like that bee acts
You're workin' too hard

Don't spend your time, just lookin' around
For something you want, can't be found
You find out you can live without it
And go along, not thinkin' about it
I'll tell you something true
The bare necessities of life will come to you

They'll come to you, they'll come to you
They'll come to you, oh yes
Folks I've just been down, down to Memphis town
That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while
Hospitality, they were good to me
I couldn't spend a dime and had the grandest time

I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear
They had a fellow named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed
All them boys began to play in real harmony
I never will forget that tune they call
Handy's Memphis Blues, oh yes, those blues

They've got a trumpet man leading the band
And folks, he sure blow some horn
And when the clarinet seconds to the trombones croon
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day

That melancholy strain that ever haunting refrain
Is like a morning sorrow song
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune again, those Memphis Blues
here must be a way to help me forget that we're through
There must be a way to stop me from dreamin' of you
There must be a star in the skies that isn't reflecting your eyes
I just don't know how to disguise how much I miss you

There must be a song that doesn't remind me of you
There must be a kiss that'll thrill me like yours used to do
I look for a way to be happy, happy with somebody new
Oh, there must be a way but I can't find a way without you

There must be a song that doesn't remind me of you
Yes, there must be a kiss that'll thrill me like yours used to do
I look for a way to be happy, happy with somebody new
Oh, there must be a way but I can't find a way without you

Way down yonder in New Orleans

Creole babies with flashin' eyes
Softly whisper their tender sighs

Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there a little while

Well, I know that things won't be the same
And I know that you're the one to blame
When you broke my heart and made me cry
I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye

Weary blues have made me cry
Well, these weary blues I'm gonna bid goodbye
I know, I won't forget you but I'll try
You know I am gonna bid my weary blues goodbye

Well, I know that things won't be the same
And I know that you're the one to blame
When you broke my heart and made me cry

Ah, the pale moon's shining the fields below
Dark is crooning songs soft and low
You needn't tell me, boy, because I know
It's sleepy time down south

And soft winds blowing through the pinewood trees
Folks down there live a life of ease
When old mammy falls upon her knees
It's sleepy time down south

Oh, steamboats on the river a coming, a going
Splashing the night away
You hear those banjos ringing, the dark is singing
They dance till the break of day

Dear old southland with his dreamy songs
Takes me back to the gallent John
Oh, how I'd love to hold her in my arms
When it's sleepy time way down, down south
When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dreams
No request is to extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
As sweet fulfillment of their secret drowns
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through

Moma when you wished upon a star
Your dreams come true

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
As sweet fulfillment of their secret drowns
Like a boat out of the blue
Fate steps in and see's you through

Baby when you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true
When you wished upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Your dreams come true
Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it's true dear....there's no one but you

I'm a singin'

Whispering why you'll never leave me
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you believe me
Whispering that I love you

Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
Just whispering that I love you
You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me

Still I say to myself
"Get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be, yes"

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance
In this crazy romance

And you go to my head
You go to my head
You go to my head
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay,
